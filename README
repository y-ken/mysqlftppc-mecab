* SPEC
This plugin implements mecab tokenizer. As of MySQL SQL syntax, you can
query in natural langauge mode or in boolean mode.

Both natural language mode and boolean mode use unicode internally, and
collates with unicode collation. The encoding conversion is done automatically.


* TODO
- mecab dictionary charset auto-detection
